## Release Announcement
- **April 16, 2024**: The latest stable release of RNTR, based on Torch 1.8.1, is now available. This version resolves the issue of slow dataloader performance, with average training times now reduced to four days.  It is important to mention that without Torch 2.0, the efficiency of Transformers might be compromised. This could result in decreased performance and increased memory usage. For future updates, we plan to introduce the following enhancements:
  - Implementation of LaneGraph2Seq on Torch 1.8.1
  - Support for FP16 training
  - Availability of trained checkpoints
  - Enhanced visualization tools

## Torch < 2.0 (Stable Version) Get Started
Please checkout for [get_started.md](RoadNetwork-1.8.1/get_started.md)
The base path will be `RoadNet/RoadNetwork-1.8.1/`
## Pre-training
```
./tools/dist_train.sh projects/configs/road_seg/lss_roadseg_48x32_b4x8_resnet_adam_24e.py 8
```
Move the final checkpoint to `ckpts/`
```
cp work_dirs/lss_roadseg_48x32_b4x8_resnet_adam_24e/latest.pth ckpts/lss_roadseg_48x32_b4x8_resnet_adam_24e.pth
```
